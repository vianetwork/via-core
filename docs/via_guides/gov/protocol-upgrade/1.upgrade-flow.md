# Protocol Upgrade

## When a protocol upgrade is required?

The protocol requires an upgrade when the system contracts are modified.

## Steps to upgrade the protocol
1. Build the sequencer, prover and verifier docker image that includes the new protocol **(N + 1)** version.
2. Deploy the Sequencer and the verifier images. At this step the network is still operating on the version **(N)**.
3. Deploy the new system contracts on Via chain.
4. The batch that includes the system contracts should be **finalized** before process with the bext steps.
5. The prover that support the new protocol version **(N + 1)** is deployed and running with the previous prover **(N)** 
6. The Via governance wallet, execute the proposal on L1.
7. The sequencer and verifier network upgrade to the last protocol version.
8. Wait the prover to process all the batches with old protocol version then it can be stopped and clean resources.
9. Done.
